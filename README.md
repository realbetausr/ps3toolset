# bgtoolset-mirror
Mirror of BG-TOOLSET, may softbrick some consoles. Use at your own risk.
# Testing done
This seems to not softbrick, ~it can be used without caution. Just dont turn off the console when patching!~
UPDATE: You must update to 4.87 or higher to use this toolset! It is not a "complete mirror" as i thought. Use with caution. Two reported cases of softbricks on 4.82 and 4.86.
